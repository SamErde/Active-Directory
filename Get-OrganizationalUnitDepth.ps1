            Group OUs by the count of forward slashes in their canonical names. 
            
                NOTE: Grouping by CanonicalName is easier to work with than DistinguishedName because the entire domain 
                name is in its own segment, whereas DNs can have an unknown number of DC segments that represent the 
                FQDN of the domain.
            
            "Name" isn't a helpful column heading for each depth group, so I change that to "Depth" with Select-Object.
