.SYNOPSIS
Loop through a list of specified domain controllers, and then loop through all DNS Server zones on each domain controller to make desired changes.

.DESCRIPTION
This script was written to change the Secondary Servers setting and the SecureSecondaries setting on all DNS zones on all DNS Servers (all domain controllers, 
in our environment.) It provides an ideal way to adjust settings for one (or all) zones across every zone server, because some settings are stored individually
in each server's registry, and not completed replicated, even when the zone is AD-integrated.

Our servers actually havce Remote Registry access disabled, so the remote part of this script will not work, but the inner loop beginning with the collection
of zones ("$zones = Get-ChildItem ...") from the registry can be run manually on each DNS Server, still saving time and providing more accuracy than multiple
manual changes could.

.NOTES
Be sure to test your changes first by using -WhatIf on the Set-ItemProperty cmdlets, and also by testing your changes manually with at least one zone. Check the 
registry and the GUI after running your script, and note that changing some zone settings via the registry will require the DNS Server service to be restarted 
in order for those changes to be read and take effect.
