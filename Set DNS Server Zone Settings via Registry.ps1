    READ THIS FIRST: This is an old script that I found in my archive of past work. I do not recall how well this worked
    or if it is supported. I hope to revist when I have time to find out. Until then, use at your own risk or feel free
    to submit comments and PRs about a better way to do this directly without editing the registry!

    .SYNOPSIS
    Loop through all DNS Server zones on each domain controller to make desired changes.

    .DESCRIPTION
    This script was written to change the Secondary Servers setting and the SecureSecondaries setting on all DNS zones
    on all DNS Servers (all domain controllers, in our environment.) It provides an ideal way to adjust settings for one
    (or all) zones across every zone server, because some settings are stored individually in each server's registry, and
    not completed replicated, even when the zone is AD-integrated.

    Our servers actually havce Remote Registry access disabled, so the remote part of this script will not work, but
    the inner loop beginning with the collection of zones ("$zones = Get-ChildItem ...") from the registry can be run
    manually on each DNS Server, still saving time and providing more accuracy than multiple manual changes could.

    .NOTES
    Be sure to test your changes first by using -WhatIf on the Set-ItemProperty cmdlets, and also by testing your
    changes manually with at least one zone. Check the registry and the GUI after running your script, and note that
    changing some zone settings via the registry will require the DNS Server service to be restarted in order for
    those changes to be read and take effect.
